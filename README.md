# Restaurant App

This is a restaurant app with two parts: a customer part and a restaurant owner part.

## Customer Part
The customer part of the app allows users to scan a QR code to view the updated menu of the restaurant.

### Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (React or Vue.js)

### Files
- `index.html`: Main HTML file for the client-side app.
- `styles.css`: CSS file for styling.
- `app.js`: JavaScript file for handling dynamic behavior.
- `qrScanner.js`: JavaScript file for QR code scanning functionality.

### Functionality
- QR Code Scanner: Implement QR code scanning functionality using libraries like ZXing or QuaggaJS.
- Display Menu: Fetch and display menu items from the backend API when a valid QR code is scanned.
- User Interface: Design a user-friendly interface for navigating through menu items.

## Restaurant Owner Part
The restaurant owner part of the app allows owners to login and manage their menu items.

### Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (React or Vue.js) for frontend
- Node.js with Express.js for backend
- MongoDB or SQL database for data storage

### Files
- `login.html`: HTML file for the login page.
- `dashboard.html`: HTML file for the dashboard page after successful login.
- `menuEditor.html`: HTML file for editing the menu.
- `styles.css`: CSS file for styling.
- `app.js`: JavaScript file for dynamic behavior.
- `server.js`: Main file for configuring the backend server.
- `routes.js`: File for defining API routes.
- `controllers.js`: File for implementing business logic.
- `models.js`: File for defining data models.

### Functionality
- Authentication: Implement user authentication (e.g., using JWT tokens) to secure the login process.
- Menu Management: Allow restaurant owners to add, edit, modify, and delete menu items using a user-friendly interface.
- CRUD Operations: Design intuitive interfaces for managing menu items.

## Database
- Technologies: MongoDB or SQL database
- Functionality: Design schema for storing menu items and user information.

## Additional Components
- QR Code Generation: Generate unique QR codes for each menu item and associate them with items in the database.
- Deployment: Deploy backend on platforms like Heroku or AWS, and frontend on static hosting services like Netlify or Vercel.

## Third-party Services
- QR Code Scanner Library: Utilize libraries like ZXing or QuaggaJS for QR code scanning.
- Authentication Service: Use services like Firebase Authentication or Auth0 for user authentication.

This README provides an overview of the technical structure of the restaurant app, including frontend, backend, database, additional components, and third-party services.
